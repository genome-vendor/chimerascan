We would like to thank James Taylor and the bx-python team for the 
efficient interval tree implementation.  The interval tree and 
cluster tree implementations are well written and fast and help to
build the foundation of chimerascan.

We would also like to thank Andreas Heger (andreas.heger) and the 
'pysam' team for there excellent package.  Pysam is used in almost
every stage of the chimerascan pipeline and facilitated rapid 
prototyping and development of the tool.  We appreciate their 
efforts to make samtools accessible to the python community.

Christopher Maher wrote the original 'chimerascan' in Perl and was 
among the first to use a bioinformatics approach to discover gene 
fusions in cancer.  The Perl implementation was used as a basis for 
this version.

Finally, we would like to thank Arul Chinnaiyan and members of the
Chinnaiyan Lab for their support.
